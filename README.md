####Problem statment
Problem Statements: We have Multiple SCIKIT Algorithms like MultiNomial NB , Decision Tree , Random Forest Algorithm, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SGD Algorithm and much More. Running or testing your Data set with all of this can be a tedious Work and time consuming with lot of repetition of code.

#### Solution :
 I Have made a smart Library which can run all these more than 8 + Sci Kit Algorithm in one and with confusion matrix and confusion Matrix.
Here I will show you running 5 Algorithm at One go
